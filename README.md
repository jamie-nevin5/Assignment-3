Summary: This data is about data science jobs from the years of 2020-2024. It goes over the the different types of the job in the field and the salaries they had. 

Data Science Salaries Data:


This dataset is from Keggle.com. A free website that has a bunch of free datasets to access. 


This data was collected by looking at the salaries of data scientists over the last 5 years (2020-2024). 


The data set was extracted from ai-jobs.net. 


R was used to clean the data set. 


The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, making sure all the data columns are the right class, made sure all the column were lowercase, checked for outlers, removed any duplicates, made sure data that should be consistent was consistent, and arranged the salary category by descending order. 
What are the units of the numeric data?​
salary- money
salary_in_usd- U.S. money
work_year- year


The data provider does not give details on the formulas used to create the column however according to the columns provided, it looks like he used data/time operation and arthemetics formulas. 


The data was cleaned throughly, and visalized by creating a couple graphs with the data. 

Definitions of the column names


job_title- the name of the job that is in data science

experience_level- how experienced the job is 

employment_type- how many hours the job is (full-time/part-time)

work_models- where the person works remote, on-site, or hybrid

work_year- what year the salary was collected

employee_residence- what country the worker lives

salary- how much money was earned that year

salary_currency- what country the money is in.

salary_in_usd- what the salsry would be if comverted into US dollars.

company_location- what country the company is located

Company_size- how big the company is in terms of size 

Different variable options​

Experience level
   
    Entry-level- just starting out in the job and practically no experience
    
    Mid-level- some experience, but not much
    
    Senior-level- very experienced
    
    Executive-level- well experienced and most likely oversee or is a boss

Employment Type
    
    Full-time- working 35-40 hours a week
   
    Part-time- working 34 or less hours

Work Models

    Remote- works from home
    
    On-site- has an office at the comapny and works there
    
    Hybrid- works from home about 50% and at the office about 50%

Company Size- the creator does not specify nor does ai-jobs.net about how many people classify in a small, medium and large company size, therefore this column should probably be omitted. However, these are ranges I found on a different job site, Indeed. 

    
    Small- having no more than 1,500 employees and an annual revenue of $38.5 million at most
    
    Medium- employ between 1,500 and 2,000 people and have annual revenue between $38.5 million and $1 billion.
    
    Large- their size and ability to dominate a particular market means that they produce the majority of total revenue when taking
    into account all business sizes in the U.S.
    


This is public information found from job listings on a public website, therefore this is all public data. 
If you are referencing sources, be sure to include citations/references as needed.
